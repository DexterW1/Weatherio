# Dynamic Weather Application

Welcome to the Dynamic Weather Application! This project was created using fundamental technologies - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a user-friendly interface to access comprehensive weather information. Leveraging two distinct APIs, the app offers a detailed 5-day forecast, an 8-hour breakdown, and current weather details such as wind conditions, air quality, and more.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Weather Data:** Display of 5-day forecast, 8-hour breakdown, and current weather details.
- **Front-End Technologies:** Entirely built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a responsive and intuitive user interface.

## Acknowledgements

- **Design and Assets:** The design and assets for this project were inspired by a tutorial from [Guy's Name] on YouTube. The icons, color schemes, and layout were adapted from their tutorial available at [YouTube Tutorial Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMwyNnjAils&t=155s).
  
  **Note:** While the design elements and assets were inspired by the tutorial, all the code and implementation in this project are original and developed independently. I did not refer to or use the actual code from the tutorial, only taking inspiration from the design, icons, and layout presented in the tutorial.
